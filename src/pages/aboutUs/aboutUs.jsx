          Our Story
        </h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2024, Cancraft Studio emerged from a passion for
          photography and a desire to help people preserve their memories in a
          tangible, artistic form. We believe that every photo has a story to
          tell, and there’s no better way to share that story than by turning it
          into a stunning piece of canvas art.
